## Kaggle Notebooks

As stated in their [Getting Started](#https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/44916) article, Kaggle is an AirBnB for Data Scientists – this is where they spend their nights and weekends. It’s a crowd-sourced platform to attract, nurture, train and challenge data scientists from all around the world to solve data science, machine learning and predictive analytics problems.

Put in simpler words, Kaggle is a place where you can find notebooks that solve a problem and you can learn from them.

### Comprehensive data exploration with Python

[The notebook](#https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python) show some basic steps how to explore a dataset before start working on a problem. A problem cannot be solved unless you understand the data.
